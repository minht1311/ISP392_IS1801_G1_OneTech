                    <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
                    <p>Onetech.vn encourages customers to check the condition of the product before making a payment to ensure that the card delivered matches the order value. We will not address any customer complaints afterward.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Return Policy</h2>
                    <h3>Regulations on Return:</h3>
                    <p>After receiving the fee, the system of onetech.vn will display and send the results immediately to you. In case you do not receive the result after payment, please contact our technical support department at the following address:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hotline: 0329976765</li>
                        <li>Email: hotro@onetech.vn</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We will directly listen and respond to your requests.</p>
                    <p>The service fee will not be refunded if you have successfully used the service on the website.</p>
                    <p>Before placing an order, we advise you to carefully review the product information and price before completing the order. Once your order is placed on the Onetech.vn website, it will be shipped immediately and cannot be changed. Thank you!</p>
                    
                    <h3>Error Handling Methods When Purchasing:</h3>
                    <p>If Onetech.vn detects an error during the transaction from our side, we will correct the error. If the error results in you receiving less money than the actual transaction amount, we will compensate you for the shortfall. If the error results in you receiving more money than the actual transaction amount, we will deduct the excess amount in your next transaction, or through your bank account if possible.</p>
                    <p>If an error occurs when transactions are not completed, we will handle your error case within 10 days from the time we receive your feedback. We will ask if you want to continue using the service. If you answer “No,” we will notify the bank where your account is opened to refund the money to your account within 3-5 working days from the date you notify us (excluding weekends and holidays). If you answer “Yes,” we will provide the service you have ordered/used within 48 working hours.</p>
                    <p>If an error occurs when the transaction has been completed, we will handle your error case within 20 working days. However, when more time is needed, Onetech.vn may take up to ninety (90) days to review complaints for completed transactions or transactions outside of Vietnam. In this case, we will review and give you the result. If the error is from Onetech.vn, we will either provide a new service for you or refund you to the corresponding account (for example: if a game card has been used before we provide the service to you).</p>
                    <p>If an error occurs resulting in transactions not being performed or with incorrect amounts, Onetech.vn will be responsible for the damages you suffer.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
                    <h3>Refund Period:</h3>
                    <p> Onetech.vn will notify you of the investigation results for these cases within ten (10) working days after Onetech.vn receives your notification (or 20 working days for completed transactions). If the error is from Onetech.vn, we will immediately rectify it. However, when more time is needed, Onetech.vn may take up to ninety (90) days to review complaints for completed transactions or transactions outside of Vietnam.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Refund Methods:</h3>
                    <p>Depending on the case, the refund will be transferred to the buyer’s designated credit card/bank account or by another method agreed upon by both parties.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cases Not Processed:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Errors not caused by Onetech.vn;</li>
                        <li>The customer's account balance (bank account, credit card, etc.) is insufficient to perform the transaction;</li>
                        <li>The system of Onetech.vn is not working well, and the customer "knew" about this when proceeding with the transaction;</li>
                        <li>We do not take responsibility after handing over the service/product (game card, phone, etc.). We will not ensure the safety of card information. Any use of the card after the delivery time is at the customer’s own risk, and Onetech.vn will not take any responsibility;</li>
                        <li>Internet connection issues: due to connection errors, broken fiber optic cables, or network disruptions that Onetech.vn cannot intervene;</li>
                        <li>Policies of temporary money holding by the bank, transaction verification policies by the bank system, the customer's account, or connection issues between Onetech.vn and the banks chosen by the customer for payment;</li>
                        <li>Force majeure cases.</li>
                    </ul>
